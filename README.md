# Data Science Apps

Several data science applications using **scikit-learn** and **streamlit**. These applications cover simple usage of **streamlit**, data exploration, classification, and regression on standard machine learning datasets. In addition, several datasets were also extracted for exploration, such as the SP500 and cryptocurrency markets.
